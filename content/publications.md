abstract = "We present Team BD{'}s submission to the BEA 2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors, under Track 1 (Mistake Identification) and Track 2 (Mistake Location). Both tracks involve three-class classification of tutor responses in educational dialogues {--} determining if a tutor correctly recognizes a student{'}s mistake (Track 1) and whether the tutor pinpoints the mistake{'}s location (Track 2). Our system is built on MPNet, a Transformer-based language modelthat combines BERT and XLNet{'}s pre-training advantages. We fine-tuned MPNet on the task data using a class-weighted cross-entropy loss to handle class imbalance, and leveraged grouped cross-validation (10 folds) to maximize the use of limited data while avoiding dialogue overlap between training and validation. We then performed a hard-voting ensemble of the best models from each fold, which improves robustness and generalization by combining multiple classifiers. Ourapproach achieved strong results on both tracks, with exact-match macro-F1 scores of approximately 0.7110 for Mistake Identification and 0.5543 for Mistake Location on the official test set. We include comprehensive analysis of our system{'}s performance, including confusion matrices and t-SNE visualizations to interpret classifier behavior, as well as a taxonomy of common errors with examples. We hope our ensemble-based approach and findings provide useful insights for designing reliable tutor response evaluation systems in educational dialogue settings."

    abstract = "The proliferation of transliterated texts in digital spaces has emphasized the need for detecting and classifying hate speech in languages beyond English, particularly in low-resource languages. As online discourse can perpetuate discrimination based on target groups, e.g. gender, religion, and origin, multi-label classification of hateful content can help in understanding hate motivation and enhance content moderation. While previous efforts have focused on monolingual or binary hate classification tasks, no work has yet addressed the challenge of multi-label hate speech classification in transliterated Bangla. We introduce BanTH, the first multi-label transliterated Bangla hate speech dataset. The samples are sourced from YouTube comments, where each instance is labeled with one or more target groups, reflecting the regional demographic. We propose a novel translation-based LLM prompting strategy that translates or transliterates under-resourced text to higher-resourced text before classifying the hate group(s). Experiments reveal further pre-trained encoders achieving state-of-the-art performance on the BanTH dataset while translation-based prompting outperforms other strategies in the zero-shot setting. We address a critical gap in Bangla hate speech and set the stage for further exploration into code-mixed and multi-label classification in underrepresented languages."
